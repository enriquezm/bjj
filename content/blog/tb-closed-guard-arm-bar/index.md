When going for right arm (just mirror for other arm)
1. Start in closed guard.
2. Grip their right arm sleeve with your left hand.
3. Grip their right arm elbow (material or cup).
4. Pull over your right shoulder (not right side of your body). Aim for their elbow on or past your belly button.
5. Place your left foot on their right hip/thigh. At the same time bring your right leg up. Be sure to stay tight. Your legs squeeze in making it more difficult for your opponent to slip out their arms.
6. As you push down on their right hip/thigh with your feet and raise your right leg up against the backside of their left shoulder, twist to the right making yourself perpendicular to your opponent.
7. Keep the legs tight against your opponent and slide your left leg against and over your opponents head.
8. Raise the hips, keep legs tight and press them down against your opponent.
9. Keep their hand against your chest and wait for the tap.

Some gotchas:
- During step 7, your opponent may poke their head out in a way to make raising your leg over difficult. All you have to do is push their head in with one of your hands, while still controlling the arm that will be submitted.
- If your opponent pulls their arm out enough to give you no leverage over their joint you can underhook their nearest leg, point your heels to your left, and drive your legs that direction. This works because you're pushing them in the direction where they cannot post. You're pushing them off of their base.
