My name is Myles, and I'm studying Jiu Jitsu. I've been doing it for almost 2 months so far and love it. Let me rephrase that, I'm _obsessed_ with it.

The purpose of this blog/log/journal, is to breakdown techniques, draw out my mind maps, and just share my thoughts on the art.

Doing so helps me learn and "engrave" everything I learn in comp or class.

I guess this whole thing is a self-experiment. I want to be able to look back 10 years from now and see how much I've learned during the process.

Don't take anything you read here as "the only way to do or think about jiu jitsu". I'm just note taking and using this whole site as a reference for myself. But you're very much welcome to use it too.

Oss!
