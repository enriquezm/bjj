Before I got heavily into Jiu Jitsu, I used to rock climb. And one thing that they share is the way you handle pure strength. In rock climbing, if you were to use purely strength and nothing else, you would pump out, and not be able to climb. The true way to climb is the balance out strength and technique. This is something I find over and over again in Jiu Jitsu.
