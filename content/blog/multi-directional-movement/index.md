Dividing up the work can be crucial when it comes to energy efficiency. What I mean by this, is to not use all the energy of one part of your body to perform an action. Whether it's a sweep, takedown, submission, etc. you should divide up the work and make it a full body involving action.

Thinking and performing this way will allow you to last a longer time and not gas out from fatigue. It not only helps with energy efficiency, but also with explosive power.

An example of this can be seen when you have a 2-to-1 sleeve grip. The fact that you have 2 hands traveling a different direction (both going same direction, but different angle) gives your grip break a lot of power. 

Another example is when you need to pry your foot out from underneath your opponents armit (if their going for ankle lock). You could try and just pull the foot in danger out, but that not only doesn't work all the time, it also uses up 100% of your leg energy. Instead, you should place your foot not in danger on your opponents shoulder area and push, while the foot in danger pulls. This 2 directional creates a more powerful action. It also divides up the work and uses up 50% of your energy in each leg, as opposed to 100% in one.

Now if you think this way with all the movement you do in your rolling, you'll be able to last a lot longer.
